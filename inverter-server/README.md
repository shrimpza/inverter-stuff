# Inverter Server

Provides a small stub server which is able to respond to "keep alive"
events generated by the Solarman "stick logger", allowing you to prevent
sending inverter usage metrics to the Solarman servers, if you want to
keep that data private.

## Setup

You will require a DNS service (PiHole, AdGaurd, etc) which your logger
is configured to use, preferably via DHCP.

In your DNS service, configure the following DNS rewrites for the 
following hosts to point to the host running `server.py` as described
below:

- `data1.solarmanpv.com`
- `data2.solarmanpv.com`

## Usage

Create a Python virtual environment, activate it, and install 
dependencies:

```
$ python3 -m venv ./server

$ source ./server/bin/activate

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server:

```
python3 server.py
```
